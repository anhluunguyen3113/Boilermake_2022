When creating an account, the user will be prompted to create a username, input their first and last name, email address, password, 
and re-enter their password for confirmation. After logging in, they will be brought to the home page of our platform, where the user 
will be greeted and have the option to look at the statistics, college rankings, or sign out. When choosing “Statistics”, the user will 
see the statistics of each match colleges played. When the user clicks on “Colleges”, they will be brought to a page where it lists the 
college and each button will bring the user to the selected college’s ranking number and win-to-loss ratio. Lastly, when the user signs out,
they will return to the main page(there will also be a message in the top left corner telling the user if they logged out successfully). 
If they try to sign up using a already made username or email the web will prevent you from doing so since all the account information is 
saved in our own database of user objects
